# Pattern Recognition System Implementation Prompt

## Task Description

Implement the Pattern Recognition System for GrymSynth as outlined in the implementation plan (docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN-2025-Q2.md). This should include:

1. Developing algorithms for detecting patterns in audio data
2. Creating visualization components for identified patterns
3. Implementing interactive manipulation of detected patterns
4. Adding pattern transformation and application capabilities
5. Integrating with the existing touch gesture system

## Technical Requirements

1. **Pattern Detection Algorithms**
   - Implement spectral analysis for frequency pattern detection
   - Create temporal pattern recognition for rhythmic structures
   - Develop harmonic pattern detection for chord progressions
   - Implement machine learning-based pattern classification
   - Support user-defined pattern templates and matching thresholds

2. **Pattern Visualization**
   - Create visual representations of detected patterns
   - Implement color-coding based on pattern type and confidence
   - Develop interactive pattern highlighting and selection
   - Add zoom and focus capabilities for detailed pattern examination
   - Support multiple visualization modes (waveform, spectrogram, notation)

3. **Interactive Pattern Manipulation**
   - Enable direct manipulation of patterns via touch gestures
   - Implement pattern stretching, compression, and transposition
   - Add pattern copying, duplication, and variation generation
   - Support pattern combination and layering
   - Implement undo/redo functionality for pattern edits

4. **Pattern Transformation**
   - Create algorithms for pattern morphing and evolution
   - Implement parameter-based pattern transformation
   - Add style transfer capabilities between patterns
   - Develop pattern extrapolation for continuation
   - Support algorithmic variations based on pattern seeds

5. **Integration with Touch Gestures**
   - Extend the touch gesture system to support pattern-specific interactions
   - Implement multi-touch pattern selection and manipulation
   - Add gesture shortcuts for common pattern operations
   - Create intuitive touch interfaces for pattern parameters
   - Support collaborative pattern editing with multi-user touch

## Implementation Approach

1. **Component Structure**
   - Create a PatternAnalyzer service for detection algorithms
   - Implement PatternVisualization components for different view modes
   - Develop PatternManipulator components for interactive editing
   - Add PatternTransformer services for algorithmic transformations
   - Create a PatternLibrary for storing and retrieving patterns

2. **Technical Considerations**
   - Use Web Audio API for real-time audio analysis
   - Implement Web Workers for computationally intensive pattern detection
   - Use WebGL for high-performance pattern visualization
   - Leverage TensorFlow.js for machine learning-based pattern recognition
   - Implement efficient data structures for pattern storage and retrieval

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Create a test suite with known audio patterns
   - Implement unit tests for individual pattern algorithms
   - Develop integration tests for the complete pattern system
   - Add performance benchmarks for real-time pattern detection
   - Test pattern manipulation with automated touch event simulation

## Success Criteria

1. The system can accurately detect common musical patterns in audio data
2. Patterns are visually represented in an intuitive and informative way
3. Users can manipulate patterns directly using touch gestures
4. Pattern transformations produce musically meaningful results
5. The system performs efficiently enough for real-time use
6. The pattern recognition capabilities enhance the creative workflow

## Next Steps

After completing the Pattern Recognition System implementation, the next step will be to implement the MIDI Generation System, which will build upon the pattern recognition capabilities to generate MIDI data from audio patterns and enable further musical composition and arrangement.

## Continuation Pattern

After completing and testing this implementation, please create a new prompt for the next step in the implementation plan (MIDI Generation System), and include instructions to continue this pattern of creating new task prompts until the core vision is fully implemented.
