# Spatial-Spectral Implementation for XenakisLDM

## Overview
The spatial-spectral implementation integrates concepts from spatial theory with pattern analysis to create a sophisticated spectral transformation system. This implementation combines gravitational field models with musical interval relationships to create organic spectral modifications.

## Key Components

### 1. Pattern Analysis Integration
- Uses existing pattern analysis infrastructure via adapter pattern
- Integrates with pattern learning system for feature extraction
- Maintains pattern relationships through spectral transformations

### 2. Spatial-Spectral Model
- Implements gravitational field model for frequency interactions
- Creates continuous spectral transformations rather than binary sieves
- Supports both attractive and repulsive spectral forces

### 3. Spectral Processing
- Uses overlapped STFT processing for time-frequency analysis
- Implements window functions for smooth transformations
- Maintains phase coherence during modifications

## Technical Details

### Pattern Store
The `SpectralPatternStore` manages pattern data and relationships:
- Stores pattern frequencies and strengths
- Maintains relationship mappings between patterns
- Provides global parameter management

### Spatial-Spectral Adapter
The adapter connects pattern analysis to spectral transformations:
- Converts patterns to gravitational fields
- Maps relationships to spectral interactions
- Handles pattern-to-field parameter conversion

### Spectral Sieve
Enhanced implementation features:
- Overlap-add processing for smooth transitions
- Frequency-domain gravitational effects
- Musical interval resonance enhancement

## Testing Approach

### 1. Unit Tests
- Pattern field generation verification
- Spectral transformation testing
- Field interaction validation

### 2. Integration Tests

## Usage Examples

### Basic Transformation
```javascript
const sieve = new SpectralSieve({
    resolution: 4096,
    windowSize: 2048,
    overlapFactor: 4
});

const result = await sieve.transform(audioBuffer, {
    intervals: [0, 7, 12],
    modulo: 12,
    density: 0.8
});
```

### Pattern-Based Processing
```javascript
const adapter = new SpatialSpectralAdapter({
    G: 0.01,
    patternThreshold: 0.2
});

const { fields, globalParams } = await adapter.analyzeAndMap(audioBuffer);
```
